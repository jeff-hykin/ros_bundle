- rospack.get_path is faked/hacked with hardcoded paths internal to this repo (idk why they're dynamically looked up anyways)
- rosout is disabled (pretends to start process but doesn't actually)
- pythonpath is dynamically edited to include `main/python_packages` for the messages
- std_msgs.msg is hardcoded and faked (msg files are not read), this should be done dynamically in the future
- rosgraph_msgs.msg is hardcoded and faked (msg files are not read), this should be done dynamically in the future
- `from roscpp.srv import GetLoggers` is avoided (no logging anyways), needs a python implementation/replacement (HARD)
